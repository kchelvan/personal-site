				With six years of professional experience developing and deploying React
				and NextJS applications, I provide a background in building and
				delivering high-performance web solutions in Agile, CI/CD environments.
				My experience as a software developer includes but is not limited to API
				integrations, converting wireframes into pixel-perfect solutions,
				performance and accessibility optimizations, and integrating with
				cross-functional teams. I have worked as a senior developer to
				distribute our clients&apos; applications built in React and TypeScript
				from inception to production and maintenance in a fast-paced, CI/CD
				agile environment. Additionally, I have been on-boarded into several
				projects to improve page performance leveraging React and NextJS best
				practices, such as server-side rendering, to reduce UI load times by
				significant margins. I have worked with REST, GraphQL, and Salesforce
				APIs and deployed scalable applications using AWS, Vercel, and Prisma,
				to deliver solutions that meet client needs and provide optimized SEO
				performance.
